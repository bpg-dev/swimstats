A web application for competitive swimmers to track their times, view personal bests, and visualize their progress over time.

> **Note:** This is a personal tracking tool. Swim times are entered manually - there is no automatic import from meet results systems, federation databases, or other external sources.

## Features

- 🏆 **Personal Bests** - Track fastest times across all events with achieved standards badges; click to view all times
- 🏊 **Record Swim Times** - Log race results with event, time, and meet details
- ⏱️ **All Times** - Browse complete time history by event with PB indicators and ranking
- 📅 **Meets** - Organize times by competition with inline quick-add during time entry
- 🎯 **Time Standards** - Manage time standards with JSON import (Swimming Canada, Swim Ontario), filtered by course and gender
- 📊 **Comparison** - Compare PBs against standards with adjacent age groups and achievement status
- 🎯 **Standing Dashboard** - Quick overview showing achieved/almost/not-yet qualification counts
- 📈 **Progress Charts** - Visualize time progression with PB markers and standard reference lines
- 🔄 **Course Filtering** - Separate 25m (short course) and 50m (long course) data
- 📱 **Responsive** - Works on desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- Go 1.25+
- Chi router
- PostgreSQL with SQLC
- OIDC authentication (Authentik/Keycloak compatible)

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for server state
- Recharts for data visualization

## Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose

## Quick Start (Development Mode)

### 1. Start PostgreSQL

```bash
# Start the database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Wait for it to be healthy
docker-compose ps
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations

Migrations are embedded in the backend binary and can be run without external tools.

```bash
# Option A: Using Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose --profile migrate up migrate

# Option B: Using the backend binary directly
cd backend && go run ./cmd/server migrate
```

### 3. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run the server in development mode
ENV=development go run ./cmd/server
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 4. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Access the Application

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

> **Note:** In development mode (no OIDC configured), the app uses mock authentication. Click "Continue to App" on the login page to enter as a dev user with full access.

## Environment Variables

### Backend

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Server port |
| `ENV` | `development` | Environment (`development` or `production`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://swimstats:swimstats@localhost:5432/swimstats?sslmode=disable` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | - | OIDC provider URL (required in production) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | - | OAuth2 client ID |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | - | OAuth2 client secret |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` | `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback` | OAuth2 redirect URL |
| `OIDC_FULL_ACCESS_CLAIM` | `swimstats_admin` | Claim/group for full access |

### Frontend

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
# Only needed for production OIDC authentication
VITE_OIDC_AUTHORITY=https://auth.example.com/application/o/swimstats/
VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
VITE_OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/
```

> **Tip:** Leave these unset in development to use mock authentication.

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend

# Create test database
createdb swimstats_test

# Run migrations on test database using the embedded migrate command
DATABASE_URL="postgres://swimstats:swimstats@localhost:5432/swimstats_test?sslmode=disable" \
  go run ./cmd/server migrate

# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run integration tests only
go test -v ./tests/integration/...
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## API Documentation

The API follows RESTful conventions:

| Endpoint | Methods | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/swimmer` | GET, PUT | Get/update swimmer profile |
| `/api/v1/meets` | GET, POST | List/create meets |
| `/api/v1/meets/:id` | GET, PUT, DELETE | Get/update/delete meet |
| `/api/v1/times` | GET, POST | List/create times |
| `/api/v1/times/batch` | POST | Create multiple times |
| `/api/v1/times/:id` | GET, PUT, DELETE | Get/update/delete time |
| `/api/v1/personal-bests` | GET | Get personal bests |
| `/api/v1/progress/:event` | GET | Get time progression for an event (query: course_type, start_date, end_date) |
| `/api/v1/standards` | GET, POST | List/create time standards |
| `/api/v1/standards/import` | POST | Import single standard with times |
| `/api/v1/standards/import/json` | POST | Bulk import from JSON file |
| `/api/v1/standards/:id` | GET, PUT, DELETE | Get/update/delete standard |
| `/api/v1/standards/:id/times` | PUT | Set all times for a standard |
| `/api/v1/comparisons` | GET | Compare PBs against a standard (query: standard_id, course_type) |
| `/api/v1/data/export` | GET | Export all data as JSON backup |
| `/api/v1/data/import` | POST | Import data (with replace mode) |
| `/api/v1/data/import/preview` | POST | Preview import showing what will be deleted |

All endpoints require authentication. In development mode, the backend accepts requests with a mock `Authorization: Bearer dev-token` header or no auth at all (thanks to `ENV=development`).

For complete API documentation, see [specs/001-swim-progress-tracker/contracts/api.yaml](specs/001-swim-progress-tracker/contracts/api.yaml).

## Troubleshooting

### Database connection refused

Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs postgres
```

### Migration errors

Reset the database and try again:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d postgres
# Wait a few seconds, then run migrations
```

### Frontend proxy errors

Ensure the backend is running on port 8080 before starting the frontend.

**"Invalid header value char" error**: This can occur when the mock authentication header contains special characters. The codebase now base64 encodes the `X-Mock-User` header to prevent this issue. If you see this error, make sure both frontend and backend have the latest code.

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR) not working

If changes to files don't trigger hot reload:
1. File changes made by external tools (like AI assistants) may not trigger macOS FSEvents
2. **Solution**: Restart the frontend dev server with `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`

### OIDC errors in production

Verify all OIDC environment variables are correctly set and the OIDC provider is accessible.

## How This Was Built

This project was built entirely using [Claude Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and [spec-kit](https://github.com/bpg/spec-kit), with a healthy dose of vibe coding along the way. No hand-written code here - just conversations with an AI, iterating on specs, and watching the codebase come together.

It started as a fun experiment to see what frontier LLM models with agentic tool chains can actually do when given a real-world project. Turns out, quite a lot! From database schema design to React components to CI/CD pipelines - Claude handled it all.

Was it perfect? Nope. Were there moments of "wait, that's not what I meant"? Absolutely. But that's part of the adventure. (Fun fact: the original 200+ commit history had to be squashed before open-sourcing because Claude cheerfully committed test data with real names. Lesson learned about PII and AI assistants!)
